Welcome to EasyMOBA version 0.1f (16 February 2017) Unity Version: Unity2017.3

EasyMOBA is a ready Unity template that you can build your MOBA with using it.
Both client & server reads the data from the folders.
You can add heroes, creatures, new hero levels, new maps, new game modes just editing that folders.
For more information, check the Documentation/Adding Content.html

Seperated client & server. Server does the mechanics, the game client simulates. All game sessions (even on single-player) run on the server side.
All the game sessions (no exe instancing) are handled on the server with a custom light-weighted collision detection system & pathfinding.
After Unity announced UNet will be deprecated with Unity 2018.4, it's no point to keep this project private.

With the coding skills you can create everything with EasyMOBA.
For example; You can create Third Person Multiplayer Action Game in hours by just editing CameraScript.cs & AgentInput.cs
You can even make Co-op mods, Singleplayer mods with EasyMOBA but all the game mechanics is holded by the server side, so even on a singleplayer game made with EasyMOBA will require an internet connection.

Playable demos (Client & Server)
